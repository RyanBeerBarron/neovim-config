# My Neovim Config
This repository contains my entire neovim configuration. All the 'plugin', 'ftplugin', I wrote, whether in Lua or vimscript
As well as, all the packages I use inside 'pack/' sorted in different directories, based on theme and what the package does.
Feel free to import this repository to try out my configuration and let me know what you think!
